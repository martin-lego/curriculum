## About me
With over 5 years of experience as a professional, I have played an essential role in creating and enhancing modern applications and RESTful API systems. My front-end experience focuses on building highly functional projects using `Angular, React, HTML, jQuery, and CSS`. I have successfully migrated SPAs into Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to ensure automatic updates and implemented state-of-the-art CI/CD practices. My ability to design generic modules and maintain secure and up-to-date environments has been fundamental.

On the back end, my knowledge of `Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, and PHP` has allowed me to contribute significantly to the development and maintenance of RESTful API systems, with a focus on security and efficiency.

My commitment to technical excellence and continuous improvement is reflected in my constant contribution to the development of new functionality and adaptation to changing project requirements. I am excited to continue facing technological challenges and bringing innovative solutions to future teams and projects.

## Educational background
#### National University of Asuncion - Polytechnic Faculty
`Computer Engineering | 2006-2014`

During my time in college, I acquired a strong background in engineering and computer science. My training allows me to address real-world challenges through the creation of computer programs and their effective implementation. My expertise encompasses programming, algorithms, data structures, computational logic, and relational databases. In addition, I have broadened my skill set through elective courses in areas such as security, front-end and back-end development, and cloud computing. I continuously apply these skills in practical situations and contribute meaningfully to technology projects and challenges.
